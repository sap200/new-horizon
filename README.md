## Running Instruction
- clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/sap200/new-horizon.git`
- Inside block-borrower-contracts/contracts deploy Auction.sol, BlockBorrower.sol, Minter.sol and Locker.sol 
- The first 3 would be deployed in EVM XRPL Sidechain (Auction.sol, BlockBorrower.sol, Minter.sol), Locker.sol will be deployed in Sepolia chain.
- Run the blockrelayer but before change this variables, which are self explanatory.
```go

const (
	LOCKER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS                              = "<<MINTER CONTRACT ADDRESS>>" // locker is deployed on Ethereum goerli testnet
	MINTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS                              = "<<LOCKER CONTRACT ADDRESS>>" // minter is on EVM XRPL sidechain
	PRIVATE_KEY_OF_ACCOUNT_THAT_DEPLOYED_LOCKER_CONTRACT = "<<PRI_KEY>>"                                // private key that deployed locker smart contract on Ethereum goerli testnet
	PUBLIC_KEY_OF_ACCOUNT_THAT_DEPLOYED_LOCKER_CONTRACT  = "<<PUB_KEY>>"                                // public key of the same
	PRIVATE_KEY_OF_ACCOUNT_THAT_DEPLOYED_MINTER_CONTRACT = "<<PRI_KEY>>"
	PUBLIC_KEY_OF_ACCOUNT_THAT_DEPLOYED_MINTER_CONTRACT  = "<<PUB_KEY>>"
	GOERLI_TESTNET_RPC                                   = "<<URL>>"
	GOERLI_TESTNET_RPC_CLIENT                            = "<<URL>>"
)
```

- Use `cd blockrelayer` and `go run main.go` to run the blockrelayer
- use `cd sxrelayer` and `npm install` and `npm run serve` to run the sxrelayer
- Now go inside the blockborrower directory and type `npm install`
- Inside block-borrower/src/env change this constant values which are again self explanatory
``` js
export const AUCTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x0B2fcD8736E5726917efb8ab476AFd63e1ae2068";
export const MINTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS =  "0x5134847Dd630F1ed4B5Cc0fc08328a204CEB2D4D";
export const BLOCKBORROWER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x94cd50Fc61Bb74DBdFCEc715fF44207faF80Ae54";
```
- Now `npm run serve` to run the project, but before in block-borrower/src/components/NavigationComponents.vue change the link in `line no 25` `<a href="<<change this link to sxrelayer's link>>" class="rt-lnk" target="_blank"><b>ðŸŒ‰ EVM-XRPL NFT Bridge</b></a><hr>`

Each sub-repository contains its own README for more detailed information about its specific functionality and implementation.
